miquels, 25-Oct-1994:
Merged the patches with my minicom version.
The original README below from the author of the patches
is still valid except that
	- your menu's may look a bit different
	- no bugs in ^control handling
	- File mode of macro's dir is set to 0600 when created
	- If file does not start with '/' it's assumed relative
	  to your home directory.
	- default file name if not set is ".macros".

Original MACROS readme file follows:


(fmg 8/22/97: update e-mail)
E-mail: filipg@paranoia.com       (best)
        fmgst+@pitt.edu           (so so)

Intro:
        This patch should have patched all the files, created this file, and
        modified the Makefile (added a -DWANT_FKEYS to FLAGS and some extra
        documentation lines).

Colors:
        These patches will allow you to modify the [ghastly] default
        screen colors. These changes will be saved to either the system
        or private config files. Here's a copy of my screen:

              +=================[Screen and keyboard]=================+
              |                                                       |
            +=| A - Command key is         : ^A                       |
            | | B - Backspace key sends    : BS                       |
            | | C - Macros file            : /home/fmg/.macros        |
            | | D - Edit Macros                                       |
            | | E - Status line is         : enabled                  |

            +=| J - Foreground Color (stat): RED                      |
              | K - Background Color (stat): BLACK                    |
              |                                                       |
              |  Change which setting?  (Esc to exit)                 |
              |                                                       |
              +=======================================================+

	Hitting letters F thru K will cycle that entry thru all the
	available colors. 

	Note that crude sanity checks are employed so you can't set the
	menu or terminal foreground == background. It just won't let you.
	You can do that for the status line since it's just another way
	to shut it off :-)

	Oh, one more thing: cycling the terminal & menu colors will only
	change the color name (ie. the physical screen will not change
	colors). The Status bar, OTOH, does cycle with the key presses.
	Go figure ;-)

Macros:
        In the first version of macros for minicom, they were also saved to 
        the regular config files. A few weeks ago I ran into a situation
        where I needed macros of more than the maximum 64 characters and
        reworked them to take up to 256 bytes (this value is arbitrary - 
        make it 4K if you like - I do :-) bytes. Note that these mods use
        set length strings so they take up space if you use them or not.
        I will make them dynamic for next version of minicom, just for 
        fun ;-)

        For now, the length of macros may be specified at compile time in 
        the Makefile with -DMAC_LEN=nnnn (bytes). It's set to 256 bytes 
        by default.

        There was a big kludge necessary in the window.c file because the
        window line editing functions uses a set buffer of 256 bytes. You
        definitely don't want to see how I got around that ;-) I also made
        a small modification to wgets function which moves the cursor to
        the end of the line when called (useful for editing macros longer
        than the width of the window).

        BTW, I tested it with 4096 byte macros... works just fine. However,
        most editors will choke on lines that long...

Config file & Macros:
        Since they are separate, and I didn't want to interfere with
        people using config files with other versions of minicom, the
        macros are saved to a file of your choice. Just run minicom,
        press C-A O, Screen and keyboard, C, and enter something like:
        /usr/home/filip/.macros (and pray that your full path is less
        than 64 characters :-)

        After you specify the macros file, do the above but hit D
        (Edit Macros) and you will get a new window with 10 numbered
        lines. Just select using 1 thru A and remember:

	^ + M = CONTROL-M (\n)
	^ + L = CONTROL-L (\f)
	^ + G = CONTROL-G (\b aka bell)
	^ + R = CONTROL-R (\r)
	^ + ~ = 1 second sleep() call (useful in login sequences)
	^ + ^ = ^

	(This is included at the bottom of the edit screen - see below)

	There are some bugs if you try to fool it with, say, ^^^M, but
	I plan to fix that RSN. 

	Examples? Here's a sample screen:

	The macros are store in ASCII format. I find it useful to edit
	macros with a good editor (like vi :-) and, since I run selection,
	I can just cut&paste complicated stuff right in, etc. (but see the
	note above on high MAC_LENs)

Saving:
	Be sure to "Save setup as dfl" from the top menu. At this point,
	you will also find out if the macros filename you specified was
	good or if you'll have to change it. If name is not set and you
	change macros and you go to save, minicom will warn you of this
	fact (but it won't save you butt and save to a temporary file :-)

	If you change any macros, don't explicily save them, and later
	try to exit, you will be given a second chance to do so. If,
	for some reason, the macros filename is incorrect or missing
	and you try to exit and save macros, you will be given a chance 
	to go back and set/reset the filename.

	The nice thing about keeping the macros filename in the standard
	config file is that you can have different macro files with 
	different config files (see the -c argument to minicom) or you
	may have the same macro file with ALL your config files :-)

Bugs:
	None. I also have a bridge for sale. Call me. If you find something 
	that's screwy with colors & macros, please send me e-mail. Please be
	descriptive or, better yet, include a fix :-)
