		Announcing minicom 1.83

A short summary of what minicom is:

Minicom is a communications program that resembles the MSDOS Telix
somewhat. It has a dialing directory, color, full ANSI and VT100
emulation, an (external) scripting language and more.

Tested platforms:
Linux 2.0.34-2.2.5, Solaris

Supported but untested (may need a little tweaking):
DGUX, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Coherent, HP/UX, SysVR4, Apollo Domain/OS, SunOS, SCO.

Some of the main changes after 1.82.1:
- fixed some possible overflows caused by i18N
- added some options to change the logfile name or disable logging, and
  to select which events to log
- multiline untag option for systems with several phonedir entries
- newline delay option in the terminal settings
- multiple phonedir entries may be given for the -d command line option
- support for 230400 bps DTE speed
- now you can reorder the phonedir by moving entries up and down

Unfortunately the Portuguese translations are not yet up-to-date, but it 
will become available at http://www.clinet.fi/~walker/minicom.html and
an updated packet will be sent to ftp://sunsite.unc.edu as soon as I get
an updated version of the file.
