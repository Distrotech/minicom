NOTICE
------

This program is, as the version number saids, in the ALPHA development
stage.  Don't expect the next version (if exists) will be compatible
with this version.  And especially, DON'T EXPECT IT IS SAFE.  (Of
course, the author thinks this version works well for his purpose --
BBS access via Internet.)


What is Modemu?
---------------

Modemu is a TELNET client with a modem-like user interface.  It can
redirect its I/O to a pty so that a comm program can handle the pty as
a tty with a real modem.


Compilation
-----------

On Linux, just type "make".  Other systems require some changes in
Makefile and/or sources.  "Make install" is not supported.  Just copy
the executable file "modemu" to a directory in your $PATH.  Only the
executable file is required to run.

Making SOCKSified or Termified Modemu also requires changes in
Makefile.  Revive some commented-out lines and rewrite directory
specifications to reflect your configurations.


Sample Usage
------------

1) Stand alone usage

  Invoked with no option,

  > modemu

  Modemu reads from standard input and writes to standard output.
  Input

  > atd"localhost

  (prompt ">" is not shown) and you will see your host's login prompt.
  When logout, you will get "NO CARRIER" indication.
  Then input

  > at%q

  to quit Modemu.

2) With a comm program

  (This example uses XC as the comm program. The author haven't tested
  any other programs.)

  Invoke with "-c" option,

  > modemu -c "xc -l tty%s"

  you see XC runs. Go to the terminal mode and input

  > atd"localhost

  Yes, Modemu makes the comm program a TELNET client.  Now you can use
  comm program's scripting and file xfer(*) facilities on TELNET.

  To quit Modemu, just quit the comm program.

(*) Almost all file xfer protocols require 8bit through connection,
which means Modemu must be in the binary transmission mode.  See %B
command description in man pages.
