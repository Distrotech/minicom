		Announcing minicom 1.82.1

A short summary of what minicom is:

Minicom is a communications program that resembles the MSDOS Telix
somewhat. It has a dialing directory, color, full ANSI and VT100
emulation, an (external) scripting language and more.

Tested platforms:
Linux 2.0.34, 

Supported but untested (may need a little tweaking):
DGUX, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Coherent, HP/UX, SysVR4, Apollo Domain/OS, SunOS, SCO.

There is not much changed between versions 1.82.1 and 1.82.
The main reason for this release is the change of the mailing list
address mentioned somewhere in the doc directory.
The main differencies in the program itself:

- option to show line speed on the status line (instead of DTE speed)

- some more strings have been internationalized, basically in the runscript
  program

- the program doesn't any more unnecessarily remind you of the need to save 
  config and restart before the history buffer size change takes effect,
  if you started with -s option and didn't change it during THAT session.
