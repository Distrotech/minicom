		Announcing minicom 1.82

A short summary of what minicom is:

Minicom is a communications program that resembles the MSDOS Telix
somewhat. It has a dialing directory, color, full ANSI and VT100
emulation, an (external) scripting language and more.

Tested platforms:
Linux 2.0.34, 

Supported but untested (may need a little tweaking):
DGUX, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Coherent, HP/UX, SysVR4, Apollo Domain/OS, SunOS, SCO.

New in Minicom 1.82: 

- call duration in the "Gone offline" and "Hangup" log messages.  

- Old phonedir version (one with shorter entry length than the current
  version), if found, is backed up at program start

- command line option "-C filename" to start capturing at program startup

- the character conversion tables are now also used when writing the
  capture file, unless you unset the capture convert option

- log command added to runscript. Now you can write text from your scripts
  with the command "log this is the log entry"

- the date is now written in the phone directory and the log file with 
  4 numbers in the year

- default value for control key changed back to ^A from Escape(meta)

- notations \u for username and \p for password in the macro strings.
  If you need the \ character in macros, type it double (as \\)

- citation facility in the scrollback buffer: When viewing the scrollback
  buffer, move cursor where you want the citation to start, press c, move
  cursor to the end of text to be citated, and press c again. The marked
  text will be sent to the modem, each line prefixed with >

- Japanese, French and Polish have been added to the language selection


New in Minicom 1.81:

- The filename selection window has been rewritten by James Seymour
  (jseymour@jimsun.LinxNet.com). When you upload files, you can use this
  window to select the filenames from the upload directory. You can also use
  change the upload directory within this window. New setting 'multi' has 
  been added to the file transfer protocol configuration screen to define
  which protocols can send multiple files with one command.
  The program can also be set to prompt for the directory each time you
  download something. (Setting 'O', "Prompt for download directory", in the
  file transfer protocol configuration menu.)

- When you start dialing and the highlighted phone directory entry is not
  tagged, the dialing function starts searching for tagged entries from the
  highlighted one, not from the beginning. Thus, if entries 1, 2 and 5 are
  tagged and entry 3 is highlighted, the dialing starts from entry 5.

- Multiple device support: You can define multiple serial ports in the
  Serial device setting in the Serial port setup configuration menu by
  separating them with commas, if you have more than one modem
  attached. When Minicom starts, it will look for the first available one
  and use it. This feature was also written by Jim Seymour.

New in version 1.80:

- Internationalization. The text strings can be changed to localized ones.
  Set the environment variable LANG to the code for your country. If you
  use bash, you can do that with "export LANG=xx_XX" in your .bash_profile,
  where xx_XX is the code for your country. Currently supported codes are
  pt_BR for Brazilian Portuguese and fi_FI for Finnish.
  You may also have to set LC_CTYPE to indicate the character set used
  in your country (ISO-8859-1 is the right one for many).

New in version 1.79:

- The changes from version 1.78-s, published by Kent Robotti, were included: 
  - history buffer search 
  - The X, Y, Zmodem protocols lrzsz-0.12.16, are included.
  - The program 'modemu.v.0.0.1', is also included, this allows you to use
    minicom over a telnet connection.

- Filename selection window was added, along with the setting 'N', 
  "Use filename selection window", in the File transfer protocols setting
  menu to toggle for using the feature. The window itself has been rewritten
  for version 1.81.
