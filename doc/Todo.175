VT102 emulation is complete now, except for:
  	- Emulation of keypad keys in applications mode (impossible?)
  	- Double width / double height / 132 characters (impossible?)
  	- Line printer support
  	- LED functions.
  As you see, none of these are likely to be needed much.
- Probably Viditel (Prestel) support will be added. (sometimes).

* Idle timeout
* after connect in dial window: CONNECT 28000/ARQ etc
* Option to turn off "press any key to continue".
* Check if write to .dialdir fails and issue warning (file system full?)
