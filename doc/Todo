Some things that should be fixed. If you fix some of the problems described
below, please tell me (walker@netsonic.fi):

- sometimes when the program closes a window, the terminal window under
  that gets improperly restored.
  Probably happens because of the cursor movement commands from the other
  end when the screen was written.

- When run from xterm, Minicom doesn't restore the window colors on exit
  (Then again, there is the xminicom script..)

- the scripts are reported not to wait for the shell commands (beginning
  with !) to finish before continuing the script
