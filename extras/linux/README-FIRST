This verion of minicom-1.78 has the additional 'histsearch' feature, 
described in doc/HistSearch, and a few changes, it no longer gives 
a warning when started without the -s switch, it goes right into 
terminal mode.

There are also other additions to minicom-1.78, read /doc/Readme.jl
for info on them.

do this.>  ~# minicom -c off  <-Turn off color.)

You can put this in the /etc/profile file to turn color off.
